## Find the Country Game

**1.Purpose of the Game**

Find the most countries on the world map in one minute.

**2.How the Game Works ?**

-First, click on the 'Gezinti Başlasın' button.



-Second, the user name is written on the 'Kullanıcı Adı Girişi' page.

-Third, we try to find the countries written on the top right of the page on the mute map.

-If the country we choose is correct, the stork animation at the bottom right flies over the correctly selected country.

-After one minute, the game automatically stops and after clicking the 'OK' button on the panel above, we are directed to the Game Score page.

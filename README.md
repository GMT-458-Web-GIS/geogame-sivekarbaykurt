-If the country we choose is correct, the stork animation at the bottom right flies over the correctly selected country.

-If it is wrong, a feedback is received on the panel above that the country is wrong.

-After one minute, the game automatically stops and after clicking the 'OK' button on the panel above, we are directed to the Game Score page.
